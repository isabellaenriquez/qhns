      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Queen's Health and Nutrition Society (QHNS) was originally co-founded in
        March of 2019, with a vision to inform and educate University students
        of the value of nutritious foods to one's academic performance, mental
        and physical health. More specifically, they aimed to help make
        nutritious eating attainable within a student budget and lifestyle.
        Since then, the interest gained by the club from our student body helped
        grow our executive team from seven co-founding members to our current
        team of twenty passionate executives.

        QHNS strives to increase nutrition literacy by emphasizing the
        relationship between improved overall health, fitness and nutrition.
        Through hosting school-wide events and maintaining a growing online
        presence, we aim to inform and advocate for a nutritionally literate
        community.
